Have there been any more reactions to the presentation that McCullough made at the "volatility conference" in Portland last week?
Have you had the boards out yet?
Haven't been able to get in, though.
He agrees to be available and cooperative with Enron and its counsel regarding litigation matters.
He also let me know that they are looking at another power plant project in the SW Power Pool and want to discuss with us.
He asked me to e-mail you so that you could put this on his calendar and said that you would e-mail his wife to check the date as well.
He brought it to Calpine's attention immediately upon being contacted by ENA. 3. Christina argued, as she did in the answer and counterclaim, that the non-compete agreement was fatally overbroad, as Miller never had any duties involving the majority of the activities from which the non-compete purports to bar him.
He can join us by phone if needed.
He can score from the wing, but he'll end up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small forward.
He didn't get it and we need to get that fixed asap.
He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement Rashard Lewis, if he re-signs.
He got to climb all over the fire engines and even get into the driver's seat and "drive."
He has a question that I am forwarding to you, since I don't know the answer.
He has never attended one.
He is anxious to see it and meet with you after he has had a chance to review it.
He is going to wait it out another month to see if a new position comes available.
He needs to be able to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a caregiver who is with his wife while he works.
He recently spoke at one of your conferences and this conference is more closely related to Mr. Wasaff's area of responsibility.
He said CT will not revoke the consent for about 5-6 more weeks, so we've got some time to resolve this.
He said every department at the utility had spent weeks pulling together information for the creditor list, to be submitted to Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali by mid-May.
He said... Let's go out and have some fun tonight.
He should be here for the management conference.
He still hasn't got the liquids ones written, he says we'll have those by Monday.
He will be here next Monday at 3:00 p.m.
He will be in the office tomorrow.
He will be incapable of discussing anything other than how he feels.
He will return to the office tomorrow.
He will send you the data.
He works with John Thompson and Scott Josey in the upstream capital markets group (producer finance).
He would like to discuss small business development and Center for Houston's Future with him.
He's in DC today at the RTO workshops, but I believe he'll be here tomorrow.
Heather Kroll will be meeting with us.

However, I also told him about my two dark-side fears: (1) that IT resources reporting to Networks would make it even more difficult to get the attention on projects that we need, and (2) taken to the extreme, that this concept would disinsent operations personnel from coming up with creative solutions to managing the growth of the business if all good ideas are swept away to this special team for them to handle.

Ken, I would like to like to schedule a meeting with you to discuss your corporate customer service initiatives.
Ken, With all that has transpired in the last several weeks, I know that you must be incredibly busy; but if you can work it in, John Kelley and I would like to meet with you for about 30-40 minutes to give you an update on two initiatives, listed below, aimed at getting the 2012 Olympics to Houston. 1. Conversion of the Astrodome to a track and field facility.
Ken, in response to the letter from Mr Miguel San Juan, my suggestion would be to offer up the Falcon for their use; however, given the tight time frame and your recent visit with Mr. Fox that it would be difficult for either you or me to participate.
Ken, would you be willing to meet with our team?
Ken: currently we get outside E-mails from PIRA and Enerfax on a daily basis.
Kevin, I would like more detail on these issues of which I was not aware - lets discuss next week.
Kevin, how do we get at the transmission without buying the entire company?
Kevin, this presentation has been revised (we explained to her that the other one was too much about what they are doing and their exclusive license, and that it needs to be more practical and topical to apply to the audience that will be in attendance.
Kick off Your Half-Year Resolution on July 11.
Kim, I am reviewing the changes you made to see if they conform to our discussion.

Michael Tribolet and I (about 99% Michael) have put together a rough cut analysis of the core/noncore structure, and some scenarios Hertzberg has asked for.

My WORD as a Christian man is to utilize the 5.8 million dollars that you will donate to me towards the church and if you allow me I have another church in mind that I will like to donate to.
My address is:

My recommendation would be to ask Maureen to attend sensitivity training and sexual harassment prevention class.
My schedule is extremely flexible, and I would like to start working as soon as possible.
My schedule should be getting better (famous last words), and I hope we can get together soon.
My short agenda is Day 1: Go over basics of financial documentation w/confirm desk team & your assistants (maybe 2-4 hours depending on level of detail we go into) (spend rest of day approving online counterparties), Day 2: Go over specifics of confirmations with your assistants so they can prepare the Special Legal/Credit Annex for a confirm and review how to read a credit worksheet and what the credit issues mean (spend rest of day approving online counterparties), Day 3: Spend time with you & Peter going over what I went over with assistants & confirm people, then maybe spend time letting any of your dealmakers quiz me as they desire about swap issues (spend free time approving online counterparties).
My suspicion is that the EES discussions are not ultimately going to yield fruit.
My system shows ENA delivered 130,000 to Canajoharie and 5,000 to Tenn-Wright one day (you though little ol' ENA was taking advantage of you).
My time is not really my own these days,and I am currently working 7 days a week, literally (my last day off was 9 September), often 12-16 hours a day.
My time is very limited next week and I am double booked most of the time.

That I ideally want to keep possible to trigger.
That KN Wattenberg order is excellent for us on the jurisdictional issue, so maybe the longer we wait the better the law will get for us.
That article, you may recall, is where ECS agreed to create a computerized system that would monitor Continental Divide's electric system utilization and warn when their system peaks were occurring and then automatically take the compressor offline (subject to manual override) so we and ECS could avoid peak period demand charges.
That change will have to be approved by Mark Taylor, who is out of town until next week.
That format would make it easier for me to transfer the info.
That is the only gibberish that you should be receiving.
That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors I need you to be in prayer with me this week.
That means you didn't send me the attachment.
That power shortage Friday cut us off in the middle of our conversation about the appropriate tax language to use for a confirmation evidencing a trade between Teeside Power Financing Limited and RMT.
That probably would make next week better for me than this week.
That said, that may not be important for you and you won't mind sending me dollars.
That should bring available cash for equities to: $190,000
That should make life fun for you!
That signed ETA Amendment came in about a week ago, and the copy has already been sent to Lisa Lees, and the file is closed as far as I'm concerned.
That sounded like a good idea at this point, ANYTHING would have sounded like a good idea and as it turned out, Officer Mike runs a plumbing business on weekends; he knew how to take out the sink!
That sounds nice but if we continue to make programs for M.O.P., I would like to use the short ones.

You guys could not work this out - so I offered a compromise position which involved a well coordinated test marketing iniative (this was agreed to by you and John at the offsite): a) the insurance group was to identify the initial 5 to 10 target customer list that ENA would pitch the product to which should give us a determination if this is a commercially viable product; b) John and Scott would facilitate the contact with the customers to ensure a consistent face and story with the customers - if you guys can sit down and come up with an alternative that works for you - great; regardless, John had promised me that he would do everything necessary to facilitate and promote this capability to these customers ASAP; c) both groups would put a deal team together and get out there ASAP; d) if the test marketing of the product is successful; I agree that we need to sit down and discuss how we formally allign the interests of these groups.
