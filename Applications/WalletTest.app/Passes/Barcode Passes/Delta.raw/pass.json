Such illness must be attested to by a medical certificate. When the flight coupons remaining in the Ticket involve one or more Stopovers, the validity of such Ticket may be extended for not more than three months from the date shown on such a certificate. In such circumstances, we will similarly extend the period of validity of Tickets of the other members of your immediate family accompanying you."
